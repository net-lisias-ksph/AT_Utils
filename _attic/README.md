##AT_Utils is a library for KSP plugin developers. 

It is divided into a set of separate modules to provide flexibility of use. Its many helper classes and PartModules were once part of the several plugins I develop (TCA, Hangar) and were factored out of there.

For now it is under a heavy development and should be considered unstable beta. The API is most likely to be changed many times over.
